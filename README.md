# Chatbot GPT-4 Using Python 

import gpt_4_simple as gpt4

# Create a TensorFlow Session
sess = gpt4.start_tf_sess()

# Load the GPT-4 Model
gpt4.load_gpt4(sess)

# Create an Infinite Loop
while True:
    # Get Input from the User
    inp = input("You: ")
    
    # Quit the Loop if the User Input is 'quit'
    if inp == "quit":
        break
    
    # Generate a Response from the Input
    out = gpt4.generate(sess,
              length=len(inp),
              temperature=0.7,
              prefix=inp,
              nsamples=1,
              batch_size=1,
              return_as_list=True
              )[0]
    print("Bot: " + out)

# Close the TensorFlow Session
sess.close()
